## Distributions of Model Accuracy

## Analysis of different error types
# Amount of Confidence
'1) different accuracy'
	The accurancy varies from one run to another due to random number generations, which creates different random numbers at every time the program is ran. 
'2) Baseline'
	A sensible baseline is about  
# Types of Errors
'1) False Positive & False Negative'
	A false positive, is when a doctor diagnoses a healthy individual as a sick one. While a false negative is when a doctor diagnoses a sick patient a healthy one.
'2) Baseline with Recall & Precision'
		A sensible baseline to ensure everyone's safety and health is to assign everyone as sick, which will ensure that recall and precision acheive maximum scores.
